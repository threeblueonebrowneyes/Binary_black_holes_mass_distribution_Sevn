    "Our aim for this project is to preprocess the data of multiple SEVN simulations of binary systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SEVN is Python program developed by the Astronomy Department at the University of Padua to simulate the evolution of binary systems. The evolution takes into account different physical phenomena which obey the patterns and laws obeserved in the Universe, especially those seen in the stellar tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus our attention specifically to those systems evolving into binary black holes. To study these systems we therefore need to extract from the whole dataset produced by SEVN only some information regarding the initial and final conditions of the binary system evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final goal is to obtain a simple and handy DataFrame listing only those features."
